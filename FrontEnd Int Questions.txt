let a={name:'Adarsh'};
let z=a;
z.name='adil'
console.log(a.name)

Solution:
a is object. Z refers to A.  both are pointing to same memory location
-----------------------------
console.log(+true)
console.log(isNaN("Hello"))
console.log(!"hello")

console.log('2'-2)
console.log(2-'2')

console.log('2'+2)
console.log(2+'2')
Solution:
The + operator when used with string it concatenates and produces a string
the  - operator when used it performs subraction so the string gets converted to number
The process of coverting a value from one data type to another is called type coersion
